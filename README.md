# DevTown PYTHON AND MACHINE LEARNING BOOTCAMP

Hi I made this project during the 7 Days Free Bootcamp, conducted by <b> DevTown

</b>.

The instructor during the session was Mr. Shaurya Sinha (Co-Founder at DevTown). I got to

learn a lot during these 7 days and it was an amazing experience learning with DevTown.

<br><br>Here's the link for you to watch the sessions as well<br>

<br>I got to have hands on experience on:

<li>Python

<li>Machine Learning

<li>Tensorflow

<br>during these 7 days, and everything was explained from the very basics so that

anyone with zero experience on programming can learn.

I enjoyed these 7 days, you can as well. To register for next free 7 days bootcamp, visit:
